## [Read the Story](https://pudding.cool/2017/09/clinics/)

## The Premise

For some people in the US, round-trip travel time to the nearest abortion-providing clinic can be about nine hours. We set out to quantify access to abortion clinics by measuring what really affects people: how long it takes to drive there.

## Collaborators

This project was done in collaboration with many of the fine folks at [The Pudding](www.pudding.cool). [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/matthew_daniels) came up with the original story idea. Background research and initial data collection was done by [Caitlyn Ralph](https://twitter.com/EarthTo_Caitlyn). [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) designed the story, performed the majority of the data analysis, made the maps, and performed the front-end development.
