## [Read the Story](https://pudding.cool/2018/01/mars-weather/) &bull; [Download the Data](https://github.com/polygraph-cool/data/tree/master/mars-weather)

## The Premise

I discovered that the [Curiosity Rover](https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/) transmitted weather data (amongst other types of data) back to Earth nearly every day. I decided that in order to have the reader understand what weather conditions are like on Mars, the data needed to be made personal. With Curiosity as my inspiration, I wrote the story from the rover's perspective in the form of digital "postcards". After all, the "human tradition" with postcards is to write home while on a long journey and report back on how the "weather is beautiful" and that you wished they were there. Incorporating the reader's geo-located weather for the day and updating the data daily added more personal elements to this piece.

## Collaborators

While I am the sole author on this project, [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/matthewfdaniels) was my editor and provided helpful feedback throughout the creative process. [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) helped me create the Node.js and Heroku app that scraped Mars and Earth weather data daily (as well as other various coding snafus).
