<h1>The Backstory</h1>
<p>I’ve been playing with <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui Xie</a>’s <code>blogdown</code> package for <a href="http://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/">almost a year</a> now, and I’m constantly amazed by all of the things that it can do. Maybe I’ll get around to turning this post into a series, with each addition explaining one more cool thing that you can now add to your blog posts from R. But, for now, there’s just one I’d like to touch on: <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first began my <code>blogdown</code> journey, I didn’t think syntax highlighting was possible. I had started with <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/">this</a> theme and any code I added to posts was just a solid color.</p>
<p>For example, when I typed code into an RMarkdown document in RStudio, it would look like this:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="/blog/img/articleImages/2017-11-15-syntax-highlighting_img/Example1.png" alt="See how certain elements are colored?" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: See how certain elements are colored?
</p>
</div>
<p>but rendered on my website, it looked like this:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>
<img src="/blog/img/articleImages/2017-11-15-syntax-highlighting_img/Example2.png" alt="Boo, no colors" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Boo, no colors
</p>
</div>
<p>Ok, so, I recognize that this is mostly text decoration, but when you have very long chunks of code it is a little bit helpful to have certain parts colored. It also helps me quickly notice if I’ve made a typo.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought this was just a blogging dream of mine until I was reviewing the <code>blogdown</code> <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">book</a> and stumbled upon <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/themes.html#the-default-theme">this section</a> which mentions the use of <code>highlight.js</code>, a <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">javascript library</a> that highlights the syntax of different programming languages. The blogdown book goes into more detail about syntax highlighting <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html#how-to">here</a>, but I hadn’t given it a try until <a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io">Mara Averick</a> shared some <a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/11/r-blog-tips-from-an-inveterate-tweeter-thereof/">tips</a> for R blogging and this was included:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/articleImages/2017-11-15-syntax-highlighting_img/Example6.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I finally decided to take the dive and after lots of code-tweaking and googling I got it working.</p>
<p>Here’s that same piece of code on my website now:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-4"></span>
<img src="/blog/img/articleImages/2017-11-15-syntax-highlighting_img/Example3.png" alt="Yay, colors!" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Yay, colors!
</p>
</div>
<p>Alright, so how did I do it?</p>
</div>
<div id="step-one-check-your-theme" class="section level1">
<h1>Step One: Check Your Theme</h1>
<p>As it so happens, some Hugo <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> already have <code>highlight.js</code> functionality built in. For instance, if you use the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme">default theme</a> within <code>blogdown</code>, you’re all set.</p>
<p>All you’d need to do is go to your <code>config.toml</code> file, and update this section:</p>
<pre class="toml"><code>[params]
    description = &quot;A website built through Hugo and blogdown.&quot;

    highlightjsVersion = &quot;9.11.0&quot;
    highlightjsCDN = &quot;//cdn.bootcss.com&quot;
    highlightjsLang = [&quot;r&quot;, &quot;yaml&quot;]
    highlightjsTheme = &quot;github&quot;

    MathJaxCDN = &quot;//cdn.bootcss.com&quot;
    MathJaxVersion = &quot;2.7.1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>highlightjsLang</code> argument allows you to specify which languages you want to highlight, and the <code>highlightjsTheme</code> controls what colors are used to highlight (more options available <a href="https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/">here</a>).</p>
<p>If, like me, your theme does not allow for highlighting out-of-the-box, keep reading.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-two-add-highlight.js" class="section level1">
<h1>Step Two: Add Highlight.js</h1>
<p>There are several ways to add highlight.js to your <code>blogdown</code> site, but here’s the way that I did it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <code>highlight.js</code> <a href="https://highlightjs.org/download/">download page</a>.</li>
<li>Scroll down to “Custom Package” and select only the languages you plan to highlight on your site.</li>
<li>Click <em>Download</em>.</li>
<li>Unzip the folder and inside you should see several files. One of these should be <code>highlight.pack.js</code>. Copy only this file to the js folder for your theme (it should be located in themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/static/js).</li>
<li>In the partials folder for your theme (themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/layouts/partials), you should see a file called <code>head.css</code> or <code>header.css</code>. Add the following code:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{{&quot;css/github-gist.css&quot; | absURL}}&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; id=&quot;theme-stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;{{ &quot;js/highlight.pack.js&quot; | absURL }}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Almost there. See in the first line of the html code above where it says <code>css/github-gist.css</code>? That is indicating that there should be a css file called <code>github-gist.css</code> in my css folder. The Github Gist theme is the one I am currently using from <code>highlight.js</code>, but again, you can select whichever one you want from <a href="https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/">here</a>. Choose which theme you’d like and switch out <code>css/github-gist.css</code> for <code>css/my-favorite-theme.css</code> (where “my-favorite-theme” is the theme you chose, of course).</li>
<li>Now we need to make sure that the css for that theme is in the correct place. Back in the folder that you downloaded and unzipped from <code>highlight.js</code>, there is a <code>styles</code> folder. Go in there, find the file that matches the name of the theme you want, copy that file, and paste it in the css folder for your theme (themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/static/css).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully that will work for some of you! In my case though, there was more to be done.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-three-blame-bootstrap" class="section level1">
<h1>Step Three: Blame Bootstrap</h1>
<p>I had done the steps above, and my syntax highlighting still wasn’t working. I figured the next logical step was to figure out if there was some CSS leftover somewhere that was being used over my new <code>highlight.js</code> css file.</p>
<p>Here’s how I checked:</p>
<ul>
<li>I navigated to my website and opened up the developer tools (in Google Chrome you can do this by right-clicking on the page and clicking <code>Inspect</code>).</li>
<li>Click the inspector tool (it looks like a mouse cursor inside of a box), and hover over elements on your website. You should see them lighting up various colors. If that’s working, click on one of the code boxes that should be highlighted.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I do that, this is what I see:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/articleImages/2017-11-15-syntax-highlighting_img/Example4.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There’s a lot going on there, but focus on this part:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/articleImages/2017-11-15-syntax-highlighting_img/Example5.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>I accidentally forgot to take screenshots when I was having this problem, so these screenshots show what it should look like</em></p>
<p>Notice how items in the class <code>hljs</code> (written as .hljs) are being styled by <code>github-gist.css</code> and the elements <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code> (written as <code>pre code</code>) are being styled by <code>bootstrap.css</code>? Well, when I originally ran into this issue, there was no <code>hljs</code> class items, and all <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code> items were being styled by a file called <code>code.less</code>.</p>
<p>I spent forever searching for a file (both visible and hidden) named <code>code.less</code> that was messing up my syntax highlighting, but it was nowhere to be found. After much googling, I discovered that it is bundled in <code>bootstrap.css</code> which has been minified (i.e., all excess white-space and formatting has been removed, making it not very human-readable). This made it really hard to pin-point the issue, but luckily someone on StackOverflow had asked <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42313441/css-how-do-i-change-bootstrap-less-code-less-source-code-to-customize-my-code-c">this question</a> already. Essentially, the top-respondent suggested I had 3 choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option:1 Download the bootstrap source code less.css. modify the file and use it.</li>
<li>Option:2 Place !important beside the css that you want to override in your custom.css</li>
<li>Option:3 Go to developer tools identify the portions of less.css which you want to override and use your own id with those elements. After that style them in your own css file.</li>
</ul>
<p>After lots of playing around, option 1 seemed like my best bet…sorta. I decided to download a new <code>bootstrap.js</code> and <code>bootstrap.css</code> file without the code.less file bundled in.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can do that by going <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/customize/">here</a> and under “Common CSS”, uncheck the box that says “Code”. I had no idea what other files had been changed between this version of <code>bootstrap</code> and the one used in my theme, so I left everything else untouched.</li>
<li>Click “Compile &amp; Download”.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Warning: you are about to replace some of your theme’s js and css files, I’d recommend copying these to a safe location until you see if you will need to undo this step</strong> Unzip the folder, and move the “bootstrap.min.js” file to the js file of your site (themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/static/js) and the “bootstrap.min.css” file to the css folder of your site (themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/static/css).</li>
<li>Serve your site using <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> and see if your syntax is working (For some of you, I assume, it should be).</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, my syntax highlighting was, indeed, working (🙌 🎉), but the layout of my page was a little messed up. That makes sense, as I had replaced the CSS file that ran my site. I decided to put my original <code>bootstrap.min.js</code> and <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> files back in their original locations which fixed the layout but my syntax highlighting was gone again. Here’s what finally got it working with my theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> file in your text editor and copy all of the text into an unminifier (I used <a href="http://unminify.com/">this one</a>)</li>
<li>Copy the output into a new file in your css folder (themes/<em>name-of-your-theme</em>/static/css) called <code>bootstrap.css</code>.</li>
<li>Search that doc for any instances of <code>pre</code> or <code>code</code> and find the chunk that has the background-color and text color that your theme is currently generating displaying. In my theme, it looked like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="css"><code>pre, code, pre code,  {
    padding: 2px 4px;
    font-size: 90%;
    color: #c7254e;
    background-color: #f9f2f4;
    border-radius: 4px
}</code></pre>
<p>All I needed to do was remove any instances of <code>pre</code> from this. So it now looks like this:</p>
<pre class="css"><code>code {
    padding: 2px 4px;
    font-size: 90%;
    color: #c7254e;
    background-color: #f9f2f4;
    border-radius: 4px
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>In your <code>header.html</code> file, you should see a line that looks something like this</li>
</ul>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{{ &quot;css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; | absURL }}&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>just remove the call to the minified version and save</p>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{{ &quot;css/bootstrap.css&quot; | absURL }}&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Serve your site using <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it! This may not work for every theme, but hopefully I hit walls frequently enough to keep you clear of them. Now go enjoy your colorful code 😄</p>
